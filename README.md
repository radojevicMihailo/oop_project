# oop_project

In this project it was necessary to create a directed graph that would represent the public transportation network. 
The nodes of the graph represented the stops, and the connections between these nodes were the routes of public transport. 
The data was loaded from text files. It was needed to be able to print information about stops and routes. 
The main task in the project was to simulate movements through the public transportation network. 
The simulation was supposed to generate a path between the selected initial and final position.
I created a strategy that finds a path that goes through the least number of stops on the way between the start and end stops,
using BFS (Breadth First Search).
